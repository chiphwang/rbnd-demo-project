1. I spent about 15 hours on the project
2. The most rewarding challenge is figuring out how to access an attribute from an object
one thing that confused me is that when you run Product.all from IRB it shows the object with all the attributes whereas if yiu 
run the same from the ruby "and the file" it just lists the objectid.
3. I built the ability to return the item and it will increment the stock. I added the brand attribute to each product and
the ability to search by brand and it will return a list of products for the brand. They were the first 2 suggestions from the list.
4. I think that still need to grow at better looking up things. I did not discover there was the slack channels for udacity  till this project.
I found the channel to be quite useful.
